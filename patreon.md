Rust was my first language that I learnt becasue I really wanted.

At the moment, I was not that experienced with programming and everyone will agree that Rust is not easy language. So I still remebmer how hard to learn Rust when you begin it and want to help other Rust beginners.

I have several platforms for that purpose. ​Rust Full Stack repostiory is one of them. The repository is where I spend most of my time to share easily testable codes.

For I started my programming with Web development, it has various web app examples such as ​the full stack chat app example below.

Until this point, I think that web development was not the main point of Rust. But, after asyn-await feature was stablized, I think this year is time to learn Rust web development seriously.

You can see that I have written various blog posts listed below and some of them are shared at one of official Rust news feed This week in Rust.

I believe that I have made values by sharing the working Rust codes and blog posts for more than a year. Currently, the repository ended up having a little bit more than 100 stars and I think the Steadylearner website is also getting many views per day.

So I think that it is time to invest more time for them and should make a decision how to improve them to help more users.

If you visit the website or the repository, you can see that there are no advertisments. I like to share codes and my programming expereience and want to help them free because I know how hard to make something work when you begin.

I also don't like the ads or pop-ups interfere your experience to learn coding.

So, you may wonder why do I need a help from you?

In the beginning, I told you that I started the programming with Rust. I spent most of time with it and hoped that someday I can have a full stack job with it. But, never happend for me with various reasons.

I was also almost giving up programming. But, I thought that I want to give a final shot by helping others directly rather than blog posts and codes.

In the process, I could find that there are people who can see the values with my work. One of them recommended to build this page.

I am sure that I would wirte code more and help others also. But, you help will be very useful for me.

For example, to make https://www.steadylearner.com persist, $5 is enough per month. But, that is the almost the same amount of income that I could get with programming for this years.

So the amount of money is not important and hope you give some help with it. I will spend the every first $5 to make the website live a month more.

I am also planning to write more blog posts other than web development and share more codes and the experience.

You can also give me an opportunity to work. I can work with Rust, JavaScript(Node, React), Python, Docker, AWS etc. I will be more happy and motivated than donation.

Thanks for reading all of this. I will work on because I could find people I can help.
