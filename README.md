# How to be a full stack Rust Developer

Test codes here or read [the Rust blog posts at Steadylearner][Steadylearner Rust Blog Posts]. You can also send me a direct message or make an issue here etc. I will help you.

[If you need a developer who can deploy web projects with Docker and AWS, please contact me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steady-learner-3151b7164/). I can work with **Rust**, **JavaScript**, **Python**, **Docker**, **AWS** etc.

**I really want to use the skills used here, please someone give me an opportunity to help your company.**

[![Rust full stack chat app](https://www.steadylearner.com/static/images/post/web/full-stack-rust-chat-app-by-steadylearner.png)](https://www.steadylearner.com/blog/read/Fullstack-Rust-with-Yew)

## The reason to use this repository

Rust is fast and strongly typed language with many benefits. But, it takes long time to compile. You can't be sure your code will satisfy the compiler or not.(There are many Rust web development relevant examples here. Find the examples you want first. If they work, start from them to make your own project.)

## Start

First, clone this repository with

```console
$git clone https://github.com/steadylearner/Rust-Full-Stack.git
```

Prepare Rust development environment with [How to install Rust] if you haven't yet.

Then, use one of these commands.

1. **$./install.sh** in **web** folder and **$./run-local.sh** for a full stack Rust chat app. 
2. **$cd static_files && $cargo run --release** for JavaScript frontend and Rust server side web app.
3. **$cd JSON_Webservice && $./run-local.sh** for YouTube vlog example with JSON Webservice.
4. **$cd yew/rust_blog && $./install.sh && yarn watch:rs** for a Rust blog example.
5. **$cd React_Rust** to test a React app with **Rocket**, **Actix**, Express, Restify, Django, Golang, Vibora etc.
6. **$cd sitemap** if you want to build sitemap automatically with a database.

You can **like** and share it with others if you want more contents similar to them.

## How to contribute

This is a personal repository. But, it is getting a little bit more attentions recently. So, contirbution is welcome. 

There is no versioning here because I upload only projects working and reusable enough.

I am not a native speaker so there will be grammatical or type errors. You can help me to correct them. 

**You can suggest your code instead of deprecated ones, imporve existing codes or ask the author to include your projects.**
